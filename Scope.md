This project presents a microcontroller-based system
designed to automate sludge level monitoring in water
storage tanks, with the primary goal of facilitating timely
maintenance and cleaning. The system employs an ultrasonic
sensor to continuously measure the distance between the
sensor and the sludge layer. These readings are then
compared against a predefined threshold to determine
whether the sludge has reached a critical level.
When the sludge level exceeds the threshold, the system
activates an LED indicator and optionally a buzzer to alert
users. This automated approach significantly reduces the
need for manual inspections, thereby saving time, effort, and
operational resources.
The solution is flexible and scalable, making it suitable for a
wide range of applications, including residential, industrial,
and agricultural water tanks. It can be adapted to
accommodate different tank sizes and environmental
conditions. Furthermore, the integration of IoT technologies
such as Wi-Fi or GSM modules can enable remote monitoring
and notifications, providing users with real-time updates on
tank conditions.
By ensuring timely cleaning, the system contributes to
improved water quality and hygiene. While there are some
limitations, such as the reduced accuracy of ultrasonic
sensors in harsh or highly turbulent environments and the
need for occasional hardware maintenance, the system offers
a cost-effective and efficient solution for sludge monitoring
and tank management.
