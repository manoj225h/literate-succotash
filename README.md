**Automated slug detection system for water tanks**

**Problem Statement**

Develop a microcontroller based prototype which alert
the user to clean the water tank as the sludge level is
more

**Result**

The automated sludge detection system effectively monitored sludge levels using an ultrasonic sensor and alerted users via LED when cleaning was needed. The prototype minimized manual inspection, improved water hygiene, and proved scalable for various tank types. Its simplicity, efficiency, and potential for IoT integration mark it as a practical solution.
